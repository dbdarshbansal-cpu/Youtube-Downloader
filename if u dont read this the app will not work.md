if u want to make this app run then u need to run the registry file i ve provided separately, but create a system restore point first <--this is mandatory, however after changing this you will not be  asked if anything requires administrative privilages, in short everything u run will run with administrative, which will be not safe for ur computer. this is unsafe sometimes. so an alternative method is to cut the youtubedownloader folder from c:/programfiles to the appdata folder, this is because i did a mistake while creating the installer iss file SORRY FOR THAT.to get into the app data folder press windows key + r at the same time and type appdata. there go to the roaming folder and paste the youtubedownloader folder there. then the shortcut will not work so right click on the youtubedownloader.exe, click on send to, and click on desktop. the new shortcut is created. after this is done u need to first run the youtubedownloader.bat after the fresh install then the app will run flawlessly by the exe.
